# CS5350

This is a machine learning library developed by Jason Zavala for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah


Decision Tree commands:
To run the decision tree you need 2 parameters (between gini index, majority error, and entropy). The second argument is the depth of the tree. 

EXAMPLE:

python3 decisionTree.py entropy 3
python3 decisionTree.py gini 2
python3 decisionTree.py me 56
